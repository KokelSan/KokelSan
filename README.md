## Hi there ! I am Théo Kokel 🙋‍♂️
- 👨‍🎓 I am a french student in my last year of computer engineering at the University of technology of Compiègne (France, Oise, 60)
- 😄 Smiley, happy, autonomous, curious, generous and bon vivant are adjectives defining me
- 🎮 I am passionate by video games since I can hold a controller, and I want to go further and turn my passion into my job
- ⚡ I also do a lot of sport, such as badminton, football, running and even skydiving !  


## Technologies I have worked with 💻
- Unity and C#
- C & C++
- Python
- databases (SQL & noSQL) 
- R
- Java


## What I am looking for 👀
I am searching a **6 months final year internship** to conclude my studies. I want to work in game development so I am looking for an internship in this domain. 
I am particularly interested in **gameplay and artificial intelligence**, but as I have already worked on multiplayer games, I would also enjoy to help on **online** issues.
