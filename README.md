## What I am looking for 👀
I am searching a **6 months final year internship** to conclude my studies. I want to work in game development so I am looking for an internship in this domain. 
I am particularly interested in **gameplay and artificial intelligence**, but as I have already worked on multiplayer games, I would also enjoy to help on **online** issues.
